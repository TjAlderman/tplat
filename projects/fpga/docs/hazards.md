# Hazards

The [1-bit multiplexer](./mux.md) and [1-bit full adder](./full-adder.md) exercises treat circuits as ideal, i.e., with instantaneous signal changes. However, transition times in digital circuits are non-zero. When designing asynchronous digital circuits, attention must be paid to the possible presence of hazards.

> **Note:**

> All combinational circuits are asynchronous.

Consider the previously defined [1-bit multiplexer](./mux.md).

Not all signal pathways corss the same number of gates, which means they will be affected by varying amounts of delay. This can introduce timing hazards. 

The Karnaugh map (**Table 1**) can also confirm the likely presence of hazards. This circuit is implemented as a sum of products. *1-hazards can exist where any two adjacent 1s in the table are not covered by the same prime implicant loop.* This is indeed the case for our MUX.

**Table 1:** Karnaugh map for 1-bit MUX.
| S\XY | 00 | 10 | 11 | 01 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| **1** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 

In the hazards subfolder, a new project of a MUX with delays is implemented in Vivado for a Basys 3 FPGA board, part number: xc7a35tcpg236-1, to demonstrated the impact of timing hazards. 

In demonstrating the timing hazards, we define the intermediate signals:

$ C = S'$

$ A = X\cdot S$

$ B = Y \cdot C$

We add a 5ns delay to each of these signals, then define $Z$ as $A + B$ also with a 5ns delay.

**Figure 1:** Timing hazard for 1-bit MUX with delays. A timing hazard occurs in the output, Z, around timestamp 75ns.

As shown in **Figure 1**, the delays introduce a timing hazard which manifests in the output Z around timestep 75ns. This timing hazard is caused by the delay in the transition of B, which leaves a 5ns period where both A and B are 0 meaning Z is 0.

To resolve the hazard, we need to add the problematic prime implicant from the Karnaugh map to our Boolean logic expression. The new expression is given by:

$Z = (Y\cdot S') | (X\cdot S) | (X\cdot Y)$

Where the intermediate signal $D=X\cdot Y$.
